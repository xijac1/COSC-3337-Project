0b58c0f4-9d3e-4802-8722-1a64485cd2a8,Soft Systems Methodology for Hard Systems Engineering - The Case of Information Systems Development at LIT/INPE/BRAZIL,,2013,0,"The Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) was developed to deal with soft systems, systems in which the human components predominate. Any kind of soft- ware is a hard system, since technical factors predominate in it. But when the software is a component of an Information System its success depends heavily on soft aspects. This paper analyzes the potential contribution of SSM to Software Engineering in order to propose a method to support requirements elicitation for the development of Information System that helps to understand and consider the human, social and political factors that will influence the system success. A real situation of the Integration and Testing Laboratory (LIT) of INPE (Brazilian Insti- tute for Space Research) was used to perform the study and to exemplify the use of the proposed method.",815.0,0,2,10.0,0,4,,0
0cee3929-a4ef-418e-832b-18a1a0a854ee,Teaching and Learning in Technical IT Courses,,2014,0,"In this chapter, I discuss my experiences applying Problem-Based Learn- ing to technical IT courses such as mathematics and computer application design and programming. One of the hallmarks of nearly any technical concentration is a critical need to develop strong individual, and typically challenging, technical skill sets early in the program, and high dependence on these skill sets in later courses, internships, and ultimately professional work or graduate studies. Another hallmark of the IT field is a need for strong metacognitive skills to analyze complex scenarios and the ability to creatively use their technical skill sets to synthesize new solutions and create working systems, much like an artist creates new works. The chapter is a reflection of how I try to: (1) Structure early courses to help stu- dents rapidly gain difficult technical skill sets without crushing their will to contin- ue as a result of harsh weed-out techniques, but at the same time rigorously demand and assess progress; (2) Balance conflicts between the desire for rapid and efficient assessment versus the need for detailed and careful assessment that avoids gaming of the assessment system by students; (3) Gradually push technical students away from memorize-and-regurgitate learning approaches and towards an independent learning model; and (4) Help students make the transition from early individual- ized skill set development to wider-scale analysis and creative synthesis of complex systems.",1491.0,0,1,10.0,0,3,,0

3f8d6e87-7fca-45f0-8aac-d512664fc97a,A Mixed Methods Approach for Measuring the Impact of Delivery-Centric Interventions on Clinician Workflow,,2012,0,"Health interventions vary widely. Pharmaceuticals, medical devices and wellness promotion are defined as ‘outcome-centric.’ They are implemented by clinicians for the use and benefit of consumers, and intervention effectiveness is measured by a change in health outcome. Electronic health records, computerized physician order entry systems and telehealth technologies are defined as ‘delivery-centric.’ They are implemented by organizations for use by clinicians to manage and facilitate consumer health, and the impact of these interventions on clinician workflow has become increasingly important. The methodological framework introduced in this paper uses a two-phase sequential mixed methods design that qualitatively explores clinician workflow before and after implementation of a delivery-centric intervention, and uses this information to quantitatively measure changes to workflow activities. The mixed methods protocol provides a standardized approach for understanding and determining the impact of delivery-centric interventions on clinician workflow.",1064.0,0,2,9.0,0,5,,0

This descriptive data is called metadata, and this term is in this thesis used as a collective noun, i.e no plural form exists. A library is a typical example of an organization that uses metadata, to manage a collection of books. The metadata about a book describes certain attributes of it, for example who the author is. Metadata also provides possibilities for a person to judge if a book is interesting without having to deal with the book itself. The metadata of the things in a collection is a representation of the collection that is easier to deal with than the collection itself. Nowadays metadata is often managed in computer-based systems that enable search possibilities and sorting of search results according to different principles. Metadata can be created both by computers and humans. This thesis will deal with certain aspects of the human activity of creating metadata and includes an explorative study of this activity. The increased amount of public information that is produced is also required to be easily accessible and therefore the situation when metadata is a part of the Semantic Web has been considered an important part of this thesis. This situation is also referred to as the Web of Data or Linked Data.With the Web of Data, metadata records living in isolation from each other can now be linked together over the web. This will probably change what kind of metadata that is being created, but also how it is being created. This thesis describes the construction and use of a framework called Annotation Profiles, a set of artifacts developed to enable an adaptable metadata creation environment with respect to what metadata that can be created. The main artifact is the Annotation Profile Model (APM), a model that holds enough information for a software application to generate a customized metadata editor from it. An instance of this model is called an annotation profile, that can be seen as a configuration for metadata editors. Changes to what metadata can be edited in a metadata editor can be done without modifying the code of the application. Two code libraries that implement the APM have been developed and have been evaluated both internally within the research group where they were developed, but also externally via interviews with software developers that have used one of the code-libraries. Another artifact presented is a protocol for how RDF metadata can be remotely updated when metadata is edited through a metadata editor. It is also described how the APM opens up possibilities for end user development and this is one of the avenues of pursuit in future research related to the APM.",2721.0,0,1,9.0,0,3,,0
